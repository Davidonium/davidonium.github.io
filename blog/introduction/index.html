I am a software engineer based in barcelona who loves reading all kinds of text: fantasy novels,
tech articles, tech books, reddit posts on /r/programming, everything on hackernews&mldr;</p><p>My love for computers started early in my life when I tinkered with a green phosphor screen computer, which brand I
no longer remember. As I grew up there was always a computer at home to learn new things, the internet and all that.
I was the typical millennial kid that loved playing games.</p><p>Contrary to a lot of fellow software engineers, I wasn&rsquo;t good at programming until I learned it at the computer science
degree, and didn&rsquo;t improve much until the latest years.
After the last year of university I spent the whole summer learning about technologies, building
REST APIs, SOLID principles, dependency injection, etc. Things that I didn&rsquo;t value much during my studies, but I found incredibly
stimulating in an internship and afterwards at work. I learned more in that summer than I did in all my university years.</p><p>I&rsquo;ve been working in software development right after my degree and I discovered that I love learning new things.
The pure excitement from learning some new concept or a new programming language that felt right is like a drug to me.
Software development allowed me to increase the ratio in which I discovered new things to learn, and I am still hooked to it.</p><p>Nowadays my main interests are backend development using either kotlin in the jvm ecosystem, go or php (mainly symfony).
Most of the content I manage to write will be around those languages/environments.</p><h2 id=purpose>Purpose<a class=anchor href=#purpose>#</a></h2><p>I have been a hardcore lurker all my life and still am, absorbing knowledge from where I can, reading relentlessly without
giving back. After some years of accumulating knowledge from work experience and a whole lot of reading, I think it is time
to return the favor to the internets and share it.</p><p>After some years working in the software industry I&rsquo;ve found out that I enjoy teaching new hires the ropes and share
my learnings with them, the look on a coworker&rsquo;s face when he figured out how a dependency injection container worked!
Pure bliss.
I hope that the blog posts I write will reach more people and help them love software development the same way I do.</p><p>Another reason to start writing is to get better at writing by itself and, since I am spanish and not a native english
speaker, to get better at writing english. So bear with me if I mistype some words or explain myself too bluntly.</p><h2 id=final-words>Final words<a class=anchor href=#final-words>#</a></h2><p>So there&rsquo;s the story of the start of my tech blogging life. No one cares, but I do it because I feel like it.</p><p>I hope some people find what I write here useful and comment, criticize and express your own opinions.
