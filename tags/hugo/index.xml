It is true that using an already existing platform would allow the blog posts to be seen more easily, but I wanted to build this using the least amount of javascript code and no cookies (so I can skip having to use those shitty pop ups asking to accept them) for maximum pleasure of the reader.
Medium has some annoying dialogs (that one that magically lists my google accounts comes to mind) and even limits the reading of some articles behind paywall, I do not agree with the use of those &amp;ldquo;features&amp;rdquo; (which is understandable for them to use, a man has to eat), so I avoid the website to the best of my efforts.</description></item></channel></rss>
